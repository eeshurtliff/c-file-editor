## Overview

**File Editor**:

**View and edit lines of a file**:

**Project Goals**:
- Create a class to handle actions to a file
- Allow the main function to access an object of the class
- Make it possible for the fileEditor class to read and write to files. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure you are able to run a C++ file.
2. play the file-editor-main.cpp file
3. Read the instructions and follow the options.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Choose from the options in the menu. 
2. answer the questions in the option you chose. 

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Install a C++ complier. I used Visual Studio Code to write this program. If you choose to do this, you need to get the C/C++ Extention Pack and the [Desktop development with C++ workload](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#remote-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
* if you use Visual Studio Code, you must open the program through the Developer Command Prompt for VS.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Improve file input to remove extra spaces and enters.
* [ ] Allow the user to create and edit more than one file.
* [ ]Create an option to view all of the existing files.
